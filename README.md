Supported backends/wallets
--------------------------


Dependencies
------------

Dependencies are optional, based on the chosen wallet:

  - `lnd-grpc`: required if you want to use the LndWallet.
  - `pylightning`: required if you want to use the CLightningWallet.
  - `requests`: required if you want to use REST API based wallets (most of the wallets).

You can install all of these with `pip install conduct[full]`.
